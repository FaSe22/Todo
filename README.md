# About this App

This is an experimental playground. Basically it is some sort of Code-Kata. However, the main focus is not on coding the todo app itself. Instead I want to focus on things like:

## Sonar Cloud

[Sonar Cloud Metrics](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=FaSe22_Todo).

## CI/CD Pipeline

This Project contains some yml files to automate testing, code analysis, etc. via GithubActions.

## Deployment 

This Project will be deployed using Digital Ocean. The Deployment will be automated.

## Acceptance Test Driven Development

As described in the excellent book [Growing Object Oriented Software guided by tests](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/growing-object-oriented-software/9780321574442/). In fact I want to practise many of the ideas from it in this project.

## E2E Tests with Playwright

## Unit/Feature/Integration Tests with Pest

## First Steps in Atomic Design

Some Ideas from [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).
I want to improve my Frontend development skills in general, since I am a backend dev and pretty unexperienced in CSS related stuff.
However there wont be any figma files or things like that for now...
